Project: Jokempô App - in Kotlin (Rock Paper Scissors App)
==================================


Introduction
---------------

>This is a project to demonstrate the concepts I´ve learned on Android development in Kotlin.
>This is an app about the classic "rock, paper, scissors" hand game. The user selects one of the three hand shapes available and plays against the app, as it randomly selects also a hand shape option. The winner is shown on the same activity.
>Same as Jokempô in Java, but with a few visual and code modifications, such as use of buttons instead of clicable images.
